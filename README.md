#  Marketing Campaign Agent
A proof-of-concept LangChain/LangGraph project that simulates an autonomous AI agent capable of planning, forecasting, and reporting on a marketing campaign, based on mock product and sales data. 
---

## How to run via Docker
```
docker build -t marketing-campaign-agent .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env marketing-campaign-agent
```

##  Goal
To create a modular, always-on, agentic AI system that:
1. Receives a campaign goal 
2. Retrieves historical product and regional sales data
3. Plans an appropriate media/channel strategy
4. Forecasts campaign performance
5. Outputs a structured campaign brief
6. Allows for human review and overrides at key steps

##  Architecture Overview

### Agent Workflow (Orchestrated by LangGraph):
```
[User Goal]
   ↓
[Task Planner] → [Data Retriever] → [Channel Selector] → [Forecaster] → [Human Review] → [Reporter]
```

### Key Components
- **LangGraph**: Manages the flow of reasoning and tool use
- **LangChain**: Hosts LLM tools and routing
- **Python/LLM tools**:
  - `retriever.py`: Summarizes mock sales data
  - `planner.py`: Breaks high-level campaign goals into tasks
  - `channel_selector.py`: Chooses marketing channels based on product & region
  - `forecaster.py`: Simulates expected performance
  - `reporter.py`: Creates a markdown report
  - `human_review.py`: Prompts a human to approve or override the agent’s plan

##  Tech Stack
- Python 
- LangChain / LangGraph
- OpenAI or Anthropic LLM API
- Pandas for mock data manipulation
