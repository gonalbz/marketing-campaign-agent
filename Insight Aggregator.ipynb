      "The Back-to-School campaign for Walmart has shown mixed results across different regions and product categories. While lunchbox sales have seen a significant increase in the Southeast, particularly for eco-friendly items, school clothing sales have dipped in the West due to a heatwave. Meanwhile, competitors like Target and Amazon are running aggressive promotions, with bundle offers and discounts on school supplies respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Key Insights:\n",
      "- Lunchbox sales have increased by 12% in the Southeast, with eco-friendly items seeing a 100% increase. This suggests a growing trend towards environmentally conscious products in this region.\n",
      "- School clothing sales have decreased by 5% in the West, likely due to the ongoing heatwave which has reduced the demand for typical school clothing items.\n",
      "- Target is running bundle offers in the Northeast U.S., which could potentially draw customers away from Walmart in this region.\n",
      "- Amazon is offering a 15% discount on school supplies nationwide, posing a threat to Walmart's sales in this category across all regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Recommended Actions:\n",
      "- Capitalize on the growing trend for eco-friendly products by expanding our range of environmentally conscious school supplies, particularly in the Southeast.\n",
      "- Consider introducing heat-appropriate school clothing options in the West to counteract the decrease in sales due to the heatwave.\n",
      "- To compete with Target's bundle offers in the Northeast, consider introducing similar or better bundle deals on school supplies in this region.\n",
      "- To counteract Amazon's nationwide discount, consider running a price match or better discount offer on school supplies across all regions. This could help retain customers who might otherwise be tempted by Amazon's discount.\n"
